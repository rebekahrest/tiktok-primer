                        TikTok makes money through advertising revenue. In 2022, TikTok is predicted to make almost $10
                        billion in ad revenue, more than double what it generated in 2021.<sup>1</sup> TikTok
                        has a large
                        user base of more than 1 billion users worldwide, and evidence shows users are highly
                        engaged.<sup>2</sup> TikTok’s users “spend an average of 96 minutes a day on the app —
                        nearly five
                        times what they spend on Snapchat, triple their time on Twitter and almost twice as much as
                        their time on Facebook and Instagram.”<sup>3</sup> The app heavily relies on user
                        engagement to
                        make money. When users spend more time on the app, they view more sponsored ads, so time on the
                        platform directly translates to higher profits. Thus developers have an incentive to keep users
                        on the platform for as long as possible.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Due to TikTok’s highly engaged viewer base, the platform has had large success in attracting
                        advertising business. Companies spent nearly $100 million on advertising on TikTok since the
                        beginning of this year.<sup>4</sup> For users, it is important to keep in mind that the purpose of
                        the app is to make money. While the app’s curation of content is fun and highly engaging,
                        ultimately advertisements and sponsored content are pushed to users to influence them in some
                        way, whether to have a certain opinion about a company or to make them purchase something.
                        TikTok’s ads are unique compared to other social media platforms because they appear the same as
                        any other video on the platform, so they are not immediately recognizable as ads. On one hand,
                        users benefit because the app’s personalization algorithm makes advertisements more meaningful
                        to users, and they can discover products that they really like that they would not have known
                        about otherwise. However, users are more susceptible to being unconsciously influenced by the
                        app because it selectively personalizes advertisements to match users’ interests and disguises
                        them to look like regular content. Ads become more powerful because the personalization
                        algorithm makes them more relevant to users and thus more influential. Judging by companies’
                        large investments in advertising on the app, they also recognize its power as a highly effective
                        advertising tool. Accordingly, potential users should be aware of corporate influence on the
                        content they view.
