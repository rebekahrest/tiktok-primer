                        TikTok collects information when a user creates an account or uses the platform. It collects
                        information that users choose to provide, from third parties, and automatically.
                    </p>

                        Information that users choose to provide includes:<sup>1</sup>

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="use">How Data is Used and Shared</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Data is used by TikTok in a variety of ways, mainly for content personalization, customization
                        of advertisements, platform functionality, and internal operations such as data analysis and
                        improvement.<sup>4</sup> Notably, TikTok does not sell personal information to third parties,
                        but
                        they still share information with other service providers and business partners. Data is shared
                        for purposes including payment processing, technical support, and advertising and
                        analytics.<sup>5</sup>

                    </p>


                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="analysis">Analysis of Data Collection and Use</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Some information TikTok collects appears to be reasonable in order for the app to function. If
                        viewers want to use the app, they must give up some information since the recommendation
                        algorithm relies on users’ viewing patterns to suggest content that is relevant to them.
                        Information such as phone contacts are shared by choice in order to connect with friends on the
                        platform. Payment information is needed to make in-app purchases, so it is reasonable for TikTok
                        to collect it when necessary, although in data breaches this information is more sensitive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that TikTok obtains and shares information with third parties is concerning as unknown
                        parties could be learning information without a user’s knowledge or consent. The user loses
                        control over the scope in which their data is shared, and by extension control over their public
                        image. Selectively revealing information is how a person shapes the way they are perceived, so
                        this practice undermines a person’s presentation of their identity. Even though TikTok does not
                        outright sell data, it is used by advertising companies who pay TikTok to use the platform, so
                        the company still benefits from the commodification of data.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Extensive sharing of data also poses a safety risk. People participating in protests could be in
                        danger from the government if their location data was revealed, and criminals could use this
                        data to commit physical harm. The most invasive data collected, including identification of
                        objects in videos and messaging content, poses risks to a person’s privacy. Besides intimate
                        details about
                        a person being used by governments for surveillance, TikTok holds a powerful position over users
                        through its access to their messages and the people and objects that appear in their videos. By
                        gaining insight into people’s private spaces and personal thoughts, the company has a strong
                        capability to influence people without their knowledge if it knows what makes them “tick.”
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="security">Data Security Risks</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        TikTok also has data security risks of which potential users should be aware. TikTok is owned by
                        a Chinese company called ByteDance. The head of the FBI believes this poses national security
                        issues, warning that the Chinese government could use the app to influence American users or
                        control their devices.<sup>6</sup> The Chinese government could control the recommendation
                        algorithm to
                        influence users based on the news it promotes or censors. They could also control the data
                        collection and software on users’ devices for surveillance and espionage purposes. These
                        measures are possible because Chinese law requires private companies operating within the
                        country to share their data with the government upon request, so the FBI is rightly
                        concerned.<sup>7</sup>

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Despite the current risks, the situation may change soon as TikTok is taking privacy concerns
                        seriously. In 2022 the app moved to route US user traffic through Oracle, based in the US, which
                        would monitor content recommendations.<sup>8</sup> Negotiations between the US government and TikTok
                        are in progress to address security risks, while other skeptical lawmakers have proposed
                        legislation to ban TikTok.<sup>9</sup> Until an agreement is passed to mitigate security risks,
                        however, it is important for users to be aware of the potential for influence operations and
                        data compromisation on the app.

                    </p>

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="prevention">Prevention Measures</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Potential users can limit privacy risks through several settings changes. Users can choose not
                        to share their contacts and turn off ad personalization, which limits the information TikTok can
                        use in targeted ads. They can also make their profiles anonymous by signing up with a new email
                        address instead of their personal ones so that their account is not linked with a third party.
                        Users can also not like or comment on videos, or use TikTok without an account, which
                        significantly limits personalization data from being collected.
