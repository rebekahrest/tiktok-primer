                    <p>
                        Ratty Match is a fun and interactive way to make the voices of students at Brown University heard
                        about their opinions
                        of the food options at the Sharpe Refectory. In a group of 4, I helped create an application that
                        allows students to vote for their favorite meals that the Ratty serves. Using the collected data 
                        from students, the system calculates the top rated dishes and creates a meal plan for the month to 
                        maximize overall meal ratings across each week. As students at Brown University who were on the meal 
                        plan, we all recognized the need for more student involvement with dining services and their decisions 
                        on what food gets served daily. Data on this topic was not only gathered from our personal experiences 
                        but from our friends’ and classmates' testimonies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project improves on existing approaches because it gathers more input from students to ensure 
                        that the dishes match student preferences. Currently, there is a survey that the dining services put out 
                        to get feedback; however, there is no incentive to get students to take the time to complete it. So this 
                        calls for a new method in receiving feedback from students, a new and engaging way to do so. The
                        Tinder-like functionality will keep students engaged as they will rate meals with smiley reactions for
                        dislike, like, and neutral ratings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We surveyed several Brown students using a google form to gauge interest in the project.
                        100% of respondents said that they would be interested in rating meals at the Ratty if it
                        affects what meals are served at the Ratty, so there was demonstrated interest in our project.
                        Respondents said that they would be willing to rank anywhere between 5 and 20 dishes. Half of
                        respondents also said that they would rank anything, even if the meals did not match their
                        dietary
                        preferences.

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="risks">Risks and Design Considerations</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        During the design process, we considered several possible risks related to project stakeholders
                        and external factors. These risks are summarized below.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="">Stakeholder Risks</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li> There is a risk that our algorithm will favor certain stakeholders over others. If student
                            preferences are weighted more heavily than food workers' concerns, it could result in wasted
                            food inventory and monetary losses for Brown. If administrators’ interests were represented
                            more
                            heavily, there is a risk that students would be left unsatisfied with the app because their
                            choices were not being taken into account. It is important that our algorithm has a good
                            balance
                            between the interests of all stakeholders.
                        <br><br>
                        <li> Our project’s recommendations may affect stakeholders unequally. Since Brown administrators
                            are
                            managing budgets for food, and dining workers are the ones making the meals, there are
                            tangible
                            consequences for them if our project makes poor recommendations. This is opposed to
                            students,
                            who are only affected through their overall satisfaction. However, this does not mean that
                            we
                            should weigh Brown’s concerns more heavily than student concerns.
                        <br><br>
                        <li> We have to be careful with our methods of data collection. Data collection for this project
                            will
                            be an intensive task, and we must be careful that our methods of data collection are
                            ethical. If
                            we use web-scraping, we must be extra cautious in how we treat sensitive data and that data
                            is
                            stored securely.

                    </ul>

                    <h5 class="">External Risks</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li> There is a risk that we will underrepresent the dining preferences of students with dietary
                            restrictions. If we only consider the majority preference of students, we will leave out an
                            important group of students who have certain dietary requirements. We have to make sure that
                            we have a way to account for alternative meal requirements outside of the majority
                            preference.
                        <br><br>
                        <li> There is no filtering that is being done on either side of our user interface to provide
                            filtered recommendations. For instance, there is no filtered recommendation for managers
                            that could better show the preferences of students that have dietary restrictions.
                            Furthermore, our rating algorithm does not take into account the needs of students by
                            filtering the dishes they can rate. We have assumed that these students would rate items
                            that do not fit their diet poorly.

                    </ul>

                    <p>After gathering user research about the application requirements and considering potential design

                        and then they will be redirected to the appropriate page. Once on the page, they will put in
                        information into a form that will either log them in or create an account. Once they make an
                        account, an email will be sent to their email and they will be directed to a page to verify
                        their email address, Once they open the link that was emailed to them, they will be verified and
                        directed to either the student or manager page.

                        area where they can do tinder style reviewing of food items with three smiley face rating

                        The ratings for each of the dishes can be accessed as well as the ability to add new dishes and

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="summary">Summary</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p> The food we consume affects all aspects of our lives. If we are given options that are simply not
                        edible or are not appealing, we are not going to be well fueled to take on the day. Especially
                        for students who don’t have the means to buy food elsewhere because of time or simply
                        because of cost, food at the Ratty is their only option. Providing healthy and appealing dish
                        options that dining services know the students will eat should be a priority. We hope this
                        application will help improve dining hall options to better cater to students' needs and provide
                        a useful tool for dining hall staff to plan dining hall meals.
