                </div>
                <p> In this project, alongside a group of four, I designed an interactive interface for an 
                    emerging startup. Our goal was to create an interface on a mobile app to solve the same 
                    problem the startup was trying to solve without looking at any existing prototypes. We went 
                    through a full process from creating sketches and mock-ups to user testing with a revised hi-fi prototype.</p>

                <p> We chose a startup called Toko. Toko is a mobile app that helps users learn
                    English and gain fluency by having realistic conversations with an AI bot. The conversations
                    are suggestions by choosing through a list of different topics, and the AI bot gives instant
                    grammatical corrections and feedback. The startup’s target audience is mainly learners in East Asia.
                    The users who our interface would impact would be non-native English speakers. Due to the
                    fact that the app is a language learning app, it has a very specific target user audience.
                </p>

                <h3 class="pt-5" id="sketch">Sketches</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>To brainstorm a variety of screen designs, we each did some sketches of possible designs. 
                    We wanted to consider several options before deciding on one conception, so we completed 
                    our sketches separately before discussing the results.

                <hr>
                <p>After our brainstorm, we combined our ideas into a final set of wireframes. The annotations 
                    describe some of the design decisions we made. <a class="blog-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/pvSaC5YstmYMQkLkj8fzi1/toko?node-id=54%3A4">Link to view it in Figma</a></p>

                <hr>
                <p> 
                    After creating our first iteration of prototypes, we attended a critique session
                    and received feedback on our design. A summary of the feedback we received follows:
                </p>
                <h5 class="">Critiques Summary</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Text across the app was too small. Specifically, “view all” buttons,
                        “browse all”, topic names, and sign up instructions, which we made bigger. </li>
                    <li>The login screen flows were confusing. We streamlined this into one
                        sign up page and one login page.</li>
                    <li>We had inconsistent use of bookmark icons for saved topics.
                        We added bookmark icons to every topic to allow users to save topics.</li>
                    <li>We had inconsistent titles for the “Continue Practicing” sections on the home and
                        notebook pages. We made these sections’ titles the same to make it clear these
                        were the same section.</li>
                    <li>We used red text for mistake corrections, which was seen as too aggressive.
                        We changed this to blue.</li>
                    <li>Our prototype did not show that corrections were made in real time on the
                        chat screen. We added grammatical corrections and a pop-up explanation.</li>
                    <li>To better use the touch interface, we added a swipe up functionality to
                        continue the conversation on the transcript screen.</li>
                    <li>The profile page had no way to edit account details, so we added edit buttons.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5 class="py-3">Final High-Fidelity Prototype</h5>
                <p> 
                    After the first round of critiques, we updated our prototype according to the feedback we 
                    received. The final version appears below.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    We then submitted our prototype to a user testing website called UserTesting
                    to get feedback from test users through a usability test. The instructions 
                    and tasks we presented to our testers appear here:

                </p>
                <h5>Scenario</h5>
                <p>This is a prototype of a language app that teaches non-native English speakers
                    English by having realistic chats with an AI bot about different topics.</p>
                <p>Imagine you are trying to learn English in this app. Navigate through the
                    app and learn about different topics and interact with the app by completing the given tasks!</p>
                 <h5>Tasks</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Imagine you are trying to learn English in this app. Navigate through the app
                        and try to chat about the topic “Social Gathering.” </li>
                    <li>Next, imagine that you’ve previously already learned about the topic:
                        “Snack Time.” Try to go back to that topic and continue
                        the conversation. Then try to learn the details of the grammatical mistake that
                        you made in the chat.</li>
                    <li>Now, look back through your conversation so far; see if you
                        can go back to the transcript.</li>
                    <li>Go back to the home screen and navigate to view all the possible topics.</li>
                    <li>Navigate through the app and try to log out.</li>

                <h3 class="pt-5" id="result">Result Analysis</h3>
                <hr>
                <p> The results of the user testing for each task are summarized below.</p>
                <h6>Task 1: Chat with the bot under the "Social Gathering" setting</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>All three users were able to successfully find the “Social Gathering”
                        topic and enter into the chat. The users said that it was easy to find.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Task 2: Continue the chat under the "Snack Time" setting</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>All three users struggled with figuring out how to continue the conversation.</li>
                    <li>The drag up functionality was not intuitive, and they all attempted to click the
                        section and saw no response and did not try dragging. Only one user was able to
                        figure it out and found the grammar correction pop up immediately.</li>
                    <li>Possibly the drag up interaction on a phone would be more intuitive than simulating
                        phone interactions on a computer. Regardless, this would be more intuitive with a button.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Task 3: Go back to transcript and view history under the "Snack Time" setting</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since some users were unable to navigate to the continued conversation page, they
                        did not understand where the transcript was. </li>
                    <li>One user that did find the page, thought that the arrow signs were confusing, leading her to misidentify
                    which page was the transcript.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Task 4: Go back to home screen and navigate all possible topics</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>All three users were able to navigate back to the home screen by finding
                        it on the bottom navigation menu bar. All users found this task to be very easy.</li>
                    
                </ul>

                <h6>Task 5: Sign Out</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>All the users were able to find the sign out button and found the task extremely easy. </li>
                    <li>The sign out button being under the profile page was expected and intuitive.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="pt-5" id="changes">Potential Interface Changes</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Based on the user testing results, we found some interface problems with our current prototype.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the main comments that we received from user testing was that for Task 2, it was not
                        very intuitive on how to continue a previous conversation. We would potentially change
                        our interface from swipe up to continue to a solid button so that the directionality of the
                        arrow symbol does not confuse the user on which screen is supposed to be the "Transcript screen"
                        and which screen is supposed to be the "Continue conversation screen". </li>
                    <li>The other main issue was that users found it confusing that during a continued conversation,
                        they could see the transcript while learning and as a static page. Users were not sure why
                        there were two screens for the transcript. We would potentially change our interface to only
                        show the static transcript page when viewing a previous conversation, and then if a user
                        wanted to continue the conversation we would not have the option to open up the static transcript
                        from the messaging page.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="pt-5" id="summary">Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    Interface design is a long process that involves several iterations of design, testing,
                    feedback, and modification. Iterative prototyping is an essential part of creating user
                    interfaces, and it is important to receive feedback at all stages of the design process
                    to incorporate changes sooner. Most crucial is receiving user feedback, as real users 
                    can behave differently than what designers expect from a prototype. Since users get involved earlier 
                    in the iterative design process, it can lead to more useful, user-friendly products.
