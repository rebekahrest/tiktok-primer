                    <hr>
                    <div class="row row-cols-md-1 pb-3">
                        <img src="assets/personas/console.jpg">
                        <p>An important part of UI/UX design is user research. Designers need to understand
                            the behaviors, goals, skills, and attitudes of the people who will be using the
                            products they design. One way that designer can "step into the shoes" of their users
                            is by creating user personas, which are archetypical users whose characteristics and 
                            goals represent the needs of a larger group of users. In this project, my goal was 
                            to create two such personas and a storyboard mapping out a typical user's journey of
                            using a product from start to finish.
                        </p>
                        <p> I chose to observe shoppers at a Lululemon store and observed their interaction with 
                            a shopping console. The sketch above shows Lululemon’s interactive digital console found in their store.
                            It allows users to scan product tags and bring up an item's description and view
                            inventory availability of different colors and sizes in the store, nearby stores, and online. 
                            Users can also browse the item catalog and search for specific item names. I wanted
                            to gain a deeper understanding of the kinds of users the interface targets, how users 
                            interact with the console, and any pain points that could be improved about the user
                            experience.
                        </p>

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="observations">User Observations</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>To get a sense of how users interacted with the console, I observed three users and took
                        note of their reactions and patterns across their use. I also noted any frustrations or
                        struggles they encountered while using it.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>There were two main types of users of the console: shoppers and sales associates.
                            Shoppers who went to use the console themselves used it to find more information about
                            a product or look at inventory information. Salespeople used the console to help shoppers
                            find certain products. In both cases, they mainly used the console for inventory
                            information.
                        </li>

                        <li>Shoppers who interacted with the console themselves mostly used it to scan an item tag.
                            They did not do much browsing of the available items. They went to the console with an item
                            in
                            hand and scanned the item and looked at that product description page only. 
                        </li>

                        <li>When salespeople interacted with the console, they used it to help shoppers find
                            specific items. Similar to the shoppers who used the consoles themselves, they tended to
                            first
                            scan an item tag to check for available inventory in the store. They also scrolled through
                            item
                            descriptions to highlight different features of items for shoppers. Salespeople also used
                            the
                            search function to look up similar items to suggest.
                        </li>

                        <li>Shoppers had some difficulties using the tag scanner and expressed some frustration. Both shoppers
                            and salespeople were occasionally frustrated by the screen’s tendency to get stuck loading.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="interviews">User Interviews</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p> After users finished using the console, I followed up with some interview questions to supplement my
                        personal observations. Although observations typically match users' descriptions,
                        sometimes observations and user perceptions can notably differ. It is also helpful to gain more insight
                        into users' motivations and real-time thought process to shed more light on possible design improvements.
                        The interview questions and a summary of user responses follow below.</p>
                    <h5 class="">Interview Questions</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What is your first impression of the digital console?</li>
                        <li> Complete the sentence: “When I go to the item details page, I want to…”</li>
                        <li> On the item details page, what information is most important to you?</li>
                        <li> How easily were you able find the product you were looking for?</li>
                        <li> What is your opinion of the tag scanner functionality?</li>
                        <li> Is there anything you would like to change about the console functionality?</li>
                        <li> How would you describe your overall experience using the console?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <h5 class="">Response Summary</h5>
                    <h6>General Impressions:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li> generally positive impressions and overall experiences
                        <li> users liked the simple, clean layout and visual appeal
                        <li> similarity of the interface to the Lululemon website was a positive
                        <li> easy to naivigate main menu
                        <li> users rated overall experiences positively as they were able to find products they wanted to buy
                    </ul>    
                    <h6>Use and Functionality:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li> ability to check item inventory in different sizes and colors was most important to users
                        <li> the sales associate found the item tag scanner intuitive to use, while both shoppers expressed frustration about
                            getting the scanner to work  
                        <li> however, all users liked the tag scanner functionality to quickly find the item’s details page
                        <li> the sales associate also liked the ability to show users products from
                            online that they might like that were not in the store
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h6>Potential Improvement Areas:</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li> the sales associate wished the number of items available in a particular size was displayed
                        <li> users also would have liked for similar items to be displayed at the bottom of a product page
                        <li>  users mentioned annoyance about the console occasionally becoming stuck on a blank loading screen
                        <li> the scanner was unintuitive and glitchy
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="personas">User Personas</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I constructed two user personas based on trends I observed from the users I interviewed. Since
                        there were two main types of users, I constructed a shopper persona and a sales associate persona.
                        The personas are constructed from a combination of traits and behavior patterns observed from multiple
                        users. As such, they do not represent real users but instead function as archetypes to 
                        help guide design decisions.

                    <p>
                        Savvy Suzie is a professional woman in her mid-thirties who regularly
                        shops at Lululemon. She loves running and likes to buy functional, stylish clothing for her
                        workouts. She loves a good sale and is eager to find quality pieces she likes at the right
                        price. Savvy Suzie represents the customer who shops regularly at Lululemon and is familiar with 
                        Lululemon’s products and sales strategies. She doesn’t need much help from sales associates, prefering to
                        look items up herself on the console, and knows about the stores’ shared inventory system to
                        take advantage of sales.

                        Sunny Selena is a woman in her mid-twenties who is a sales associate at Lululemon. She likes to
                        do yoga and hiking and has many clothes from Lululemon which fit her active lifestyle. She
                        always approaches customers with a bright attitude and cheery smile, and she enjoys helping
                        customers find the gear that helps them perform their best. Selena finds the interactive console
                        in store helpful for quickly scanning item tags and checking the inventory of products for
                        customers, although she wishes it showed the number of items in stock. She also finds it useful
                        for explaining technical features of clothing for different activities and for showing customers
                        other products they might like. Selena represents a typical Lululemon sales associate who is eager 
                        to help out customers and share the feature of their favorite items.

                    <p>After constructing the personas, I zeroed in on Suzie's interaction with the console to understand
                        more about her specific needs and frustration points when using it. I based this interaction off of
                        my observations of the shoppers who used the console and the struggles they encountered. I constructed 
                        a storyboard mapping out a typical interaction Suzie might have with the console from start to finish.</p>

                        Personas are powerful tools for the design process. Future improvements to Lululemon's console
                        can be guided by the personas of users who interact with it, keeping in mind the needs and behaviors
                        specific to them. Personas and storyboards are essential for creating understanding and 
                        empathy with end users so that designs reflect the needs of the intended audience.
