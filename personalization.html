                    <p>
                        TikTok’s main page is the “For You” feed, which shows a personalized feed of videos tailored to
                        a user’s interests. The page uses a recommendation system designed to make the feed relevant to
                        the user and to increase their engagement with the app.
                        TikTok ranks videos according to factors that indicate content users are interested in as well
                        as content that they are not interested in. According to TikTok, several factors are taken into
                        account:<sup>1</sup>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User interaction, which includes the videos users watch, like, and share, accounts that
                            users follow, and users’ comments.</li>
                        <li>Video information, including captions, music, and hashtags.</li>
                        <li>Account settings such as language, country, and device type.</li>
                    </ul>

                    The app learns from users over time and becomes better at recommending videos to users as it gets
                    more data about users’ preferences. Users can also manually influence the algorithm by marking
                    videos that they are not interested in or hiding videos from a certain creator.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="watch">A Key Missing Component: Time Spent Watching</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        It is important to note that TikTok is not exactly being straightforward in their explanation of
                        their algorithm. Independent studies have found that the most important metric to TikTok’s
                        recommendation algorithm is time spent viewing a video. Videos watched in full or rewatched are
                        weighed heavily, while those skipped are devalued. In a study by the Wall Street Journal, they
                        created over 100 automated TikTok accounts with dates of birth, locations, and interests to
                        understand how the app’s recommendation system works.<sup>2</sup> The only way the bots
                        expressed their
                        interests was by lingering on certain videos, and the app was able to figure out many of the
                        bots’ interests in less than 2 hours.<sup>3</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is unclear why TikTok has obscured the importance of the watch time metric, but it probably
                        relates to the fact that their personalization algorithm is the basis of how the app functions
                        and the company’s revenue stream. Likely, the company sees no reason to divulge proprietary
                        information that could be used by competitors. Regardless, it is important for users to
                        understand the personalization algorithm because it affects the content they are exposed to and
                        their viewing behavior. Since the company profits from user engagement through advertisements,
                        it has an incentive to make the feed as engaging as possible to keep users on the app. While
                        users benefit from highly entertaining content, the company’s goal is troubling; essentially the
                        way to increase engagement is to encourage addictive viewing habits of viewers.
                    </p>


                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="implications">The Personalization Algorithm’s Content Implications</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        The functioning of the recommendation algorithm has implications for the kind of content shown.
                        The WSJ found that at first, the app serves users a wide variety of highly-viewed videos to
                        determine their interests.<sup>4</sup> Then, as it begins to learn the user’s preferences, it
                        serves
                        increasingly niche content, which is more likely to be sensitive or extreme, and tends to be
                        less moderated.<sup>5</sup> In the WSJ’s investigation, after about 40 minutes of time on the
                        app, 93%
                        of the videos shown to a bot with interests in “depression” and “sadness” were related to
                        depression and mental health. <sup>6</sup> While the app supposedly diversifies recommendations
                        to show
                        other content, the majority of the remaining 7% of videos shown were ads.<sup>7</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The results suggest TikTok has the potential to take advantage of people’s addictive tendencies
                        and push
                        them towards dark content. By focusing on watch time, the app is steered towards showing
                        content to which users are vulnerable, rather than simply content the user likes or finds most
                        enjoyable. For any user, it means the app will likely detect sensitive information about them
                        including mental health issues and drug or other addictions and use that information against
                        them. The consequences are especially worrying for vulnerable populations. People with suicidal
                        thoughts could be negatively impacted when shown a constant stream of depressive content.
                        Impressionable young viewers are especially vulnerable to influence if they are pushed toward
                        content that encourages suicide or self-harm. In fact in 2021, two girls ages 8 and 9 died after
                        viewing the “blackout challenge” which encourages users to choke themselves until they pass
                        out.<sup>8</sup> Potential users of the app must consider just how powerful the app’s influence
                        is and the possibility of it exploiting dark tendencies.
