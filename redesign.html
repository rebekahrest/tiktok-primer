                    <hr>

                    <br />
                    <p>For this project, my goal was to redesign a website that had serious flaws related to
                        usability and accessibility standards. I went through the entire workflow of a redesign,
                        starting from
                        identifying flaws, creating low-fidelity sketches, composing a style guide, creating
                        high-fidelity prototypes
                        for different screen sizes, and finally a building redesigned website. I chose to redesign a
                        local pizza restaurant’s website called Adrian’s Pizza
                        because I have interacted with it in the past and was not satisfied with my experience,
                        so I think this website could benefit from a redesign. </p>

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="issues">Webpage Usability Issues</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <img class="pb-4" src="assets/redesign/adrians.png" width="80%">
                    <p>This is the original webpage. I identified several usability issues with the website related
                        to efficiency, learnability, and
                        memorability.
                    </p>
                    <ol>

                        <li>The website uses inconsistent fonts with multiple styles (drop shadow, plain black text,
                            embedded in an image),
                            which hurts readability.
                        </li>

                        <li>The page has text embedded in images which is blurry, and the red title with drop
                            shadow has poor contrast with the background.
                        </li>

                        <li> The website has poor memorability. There is no constant color scheme and company branding
                            colors are not clear to customers.
                        </li>

                        <li>The page is not responsive to resizing for different screen sizes, making it unusable on
                            devices besides laptops.
                        </li>

                        <li>The two separate buttons for ordering at different locations are potentially confusing to
                            users,
                            who may click on the first order button they see according to scanning hierarchy-most likely
                            the one on the left.
                        </li>

                        <li> There is a tab for online ordering on the navigation bar which links back to the main page,
                            so it doesn’t cause any visual change, potentially causing users to think the link is
                            broken.
                        </li>

                    </ol>

                    <!-- <h3 class="pt-5" id="accessibility">Accessibility Testing</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        WebAIM WAVE, a site with evaluation tools for assessing website accessibility to individuals
                        with disabilities, found
                        several accessibility issues with the website. Here are a few that stood out:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>WAVE found that there was very low contrast between text and background colors, which hurts
                            text readability.</li>
                        <li> Images do not have alternative text, which means the content of images won’t be available
                            to screen reader users.</li>
                        <li> The language of the page is not identified, which does not allow for automatic translation
                            of a page. Several text items
                            were in images, which is a poor choice for translation reasons and even just showing up on
                            the page when images don’t load.</li>
                        <li> The online ordering link is a redundant link, which links to the home page. This was an
                            issue that I identified as well.</li>
                    </ol> -->

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="lofi">Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>To begin my redesign process, I began by sketching some low fidelity wireframes of a redesigned
                        website for multiple screen sizes: computer, ipad, and phone. This is an important step
                        for making a website responsive to design different screen configurations for different devices.
                        I carefully considered what needed to change between devices while keeping a consistent design feel.
                        Notably, on the phone screen the top navigation bar was condensed into a hamburger menu.

                    <br /><br />
                    <h5 class="">Ipad</h5>

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="style">Style Guide</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p> Next, I constructed a style guide to use when constructing
                        high-fidelity prototypes. It details colors, heading and body text styles, and buttons and tabs.
                        I decided to use a color palette of white, and black for a sleek design feel with highlights
                        of red for some color pop.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="hifi">High Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>After constructing a style guide, I used it to compose high-fidelity protoptypes, again for each
                        of the screen sizes. I kept the page layouts consistent from the low-fidelity 
                        wireframes as the components worked well together in the mockup without much
                        adjustment.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="">Computer</h5>
                    <img src="assets/redesign/computer.jpg" width="80%">
                    <br /><br />
                    <h5 class="">Ipad</h5>
                    <img src="assets/redesign/ipad.jpg" width="60%">
                    <br /><br />
                    <h5 class="">Phone</h5>
                    <img src="assets/redesign/phone.jpg" width="70%">


                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="redesign">Final Redesigned Page</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <img src="assets/redesign/webpage.png" width="90%">
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Finally, I created a responsive webpage according to my high-fidelity prototypes. The final
                        result can be viewed
                        <a class ="blog-link" href="./responsive redesign/src/AdriansPizza.html">here.</a>
                        I was able to replicate my high-fidelity prototypes pretty closely on the 
                        final webpage. The website is also responsive to different screen sizes 
                        and adjusts the layout accordingly.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="pt-5" id="summary">Summary</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p> This project was great practice in the workflow of redesigning a website.
                        The visual design of a webpage plays a large role in the user's experience.
                        The responsiveness of a page is a crucial part of reaching users who access
                        pages on different devices. Creating a great responsive webpage is a difficult
                        task, and I have a newfound appreciation for the hard work that goes into creating 
                        well-designed webpages.
                    </p>
